## About

This is a simple program that takes a credit card number and checks if it's a legit card.<br/>
The program is written in .NET 6.0 but should work on any and all versions of .NET and .NET Core.

## How to use
Download, compile and run the code.<br/>
You will be prompted to enter a card number.<br/>
Use https://www.paypalobjects.com/en_GB/vhelp/paypalmanager_help/credit_card_numbers.htm for dummy cards if you are not comfortable entering real cards into the program.

## Why was it made
This program was only made in order to prove my capability of understanding and breaking down problems.<br/>
It serves no other purpose than being a receipt of my knowledge.<br/>
<b><i>This is also the reason as to why the code is so heavily over-commented.</i></b>
